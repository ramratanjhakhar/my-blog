## Implementing Smart Farming: Step-by-Step

1. **Start Small** (Pilot Project)  
   - Begin with soil sensors (â‚¹5,000-15,000)  
   - 1-acre test plot  

2. **Government Schemes**  
   - [Kisan Drone Subsidy](https://agricoop.gov.in): 50% cost coverage  
   - PM-KUSUM for solar pumps  

3. **Data Integration**  
   - Combine weather APIs with farm management apps  
   - Example: [AgriApp](https://agriapp.in) (Made in India solution)
